description: Apps and engines loaded when an Asset is loaded. Since std VFX config
  template has a file system structure which is centered around pipeline steps, this
  environment is largely empty. Most of the work takes place on a level in the file
  system where both an asset and a pipeline step is available - e.g Asset Hero, modeling,
  so all apps for loading, publishing etc. are located in the asset_step environment.
  This environment mostly contains utility apps and the tank work files app, which
  lets you choose a task to work on and load associated content into an application.
