# General File Manager configuration.
# -----------------------------------
# This configuration is used whenever a general file manager
# is needed. This configuration doesn't look for files,
# but only lets you switch to a valid work area. When a user
# switches (by selecting a task), the engine is restarted, and
# another environment is loaded in. This environment will
# have another file manager app running, with different settings,
# allowing files to be loaded and saved.
#
# References to this @workfiles2 include typically appears at
# 'transit' levels in the configuration, where work normally
# doesn't happen, but you just want the user to jump to their
# work area. The work area is typically a task or pipeline step
# and these 'transit' areas can be project, shot, or sequence level.
